# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_BANK_EMPLOYEE_DATA

I created an Excel Dashboard using employee personnel data to analyze demographic,educational, and additional details of individuals in collaboration with unp education .where It includes interactive charts,filters and summary tables.It includes 20–30 and 30–40 age groups have the highest gender distribution, with a near-even split in the 20–30 group (314 females, 326 males).Among education levels, most working individuals have a higher education background (1,239 people), with women significantly outnumbering men.Employment status data shows 3,854 individuals are employed, while 728 are unemployed, indicating a majority have jobs.People with a commercial associate role have the highest average income, especially males (around 236,750).Pensioners have notably lower average incomes, with females averaging around 142,106. Most people reside in "House / apartment" types (4,081 out of total), with a small number in co-op apartments.Gender and occupation distribution shows females are more present in most categories, particularly in working and higher education groups. Therefore our dashboard enhances decision making and enalyzes bank applicants data.
